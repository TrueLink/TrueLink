TlhtAlgo.prototype.addCowriter = function (id) {
    invariant(this._id, "addCowriter is disabled is single mode"); << fails here
    this._cowriters.push(id);
}

fails when creating new contact after tlke if there are any devices in sync
TlecBuilder has profileId though

addCowriter(...) is called before TlhtAlgo.init(...)?
